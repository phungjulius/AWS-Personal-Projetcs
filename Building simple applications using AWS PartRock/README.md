<h1>Project overview</h1>
<p>In this small project, I practise using AWS PartRock to develop few simply and fun applications, aimed at enhancing our productivity and organization in our livehood. AWS PartyRock is a new service offered by AWS, aiming to simplify the app development throught the assistant of generative AI. I have had a lot of fun playingaround with this PartyRock. And here is one of those very small projects that I have developed using PartyRock</p>

<h1>Performance steps</h1>
<p>In this project, I have gone through the following steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Generating the application using one of the options offered by PartyRock</li>
    <li>Changes in exiting widgets</li>
    <li>Adding new widgets</li>
    <li>Publishing the application</li>
</ol>

<h1>Services using in this project</h1>
<p>AWS PartyRock: This is a new services offered by aws, a playground to build application with the help of generative AI. AWS PartRock makes it easier to build your own application with AI, without any coding experience. AWS PartyRock offers three options to create app, by using prompts, remix an app, and starting with an empty app.</p> 

<ul>Building an application using prompt seems to be the easiest choise among those options above. To build an app using prompt, you just simply need to insert few sentences to describe how you want your application works as an input and generative AI will deliver an application accroding to your description as an output. </ul>

<ul>Remix an app: This idea is creating your own application that is inspired by other existing application. It allows you to modify and make any changes from an existing app to create your own application using edit mode</ul>

<ul>Start with an empty app: Chosing this option, you will have the opportunity to start from a blank page, building from the scratch and having fully control over your own application concept.</ul>

<p>In this project, I have tried building a simply application using first two options: using prompt and remix with the existing applications. There is no limitation of application ideas and it takes about 1-2 minutes for the generative AI to product an application according to your prompts.</p>

<p>Some applications that I have built using PartyRock:</p>

<ul> <a href="https://partyrock.aws/u/juliusphung/SW3NsNuke/Movie-Guide">Movie Guide</a>: I made some modifications from the existing application to create my own movie recommendation application

</ul>



<ul> <a href="https://partyrock.aws/u/juliusphung/Co32IvBjS/Culinary-Concierge">Culinary Concierge</a>: By giving a prompt "Build a simple application that takes ingredients, time, and cuisine inputs to suggest a cooking instruction and nutrition facts table", I have build my own application that simply suggest a cooking instruction from those ingredients inputs and prefered timing.
