<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>According to Amazon Web Services (AWS), cloud computing is on-demand delivery of IT computing resources like servers, storages, databases, networking, software, and analytics over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access the technology services, such as computing power, storage, and database, on an as-needed basis from the cloud provider like AWS.</p>

<p>AWS provides many services in cloud computing to address clients’ different matters. A solutions architect based on clients’ requirements and demands to design a flexible, reliable, scalable, and cost-effective solution that included the combination of infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, and software as a service.</p>

<p>In my Github repository, I will demonstrate some small interesting personal projects using AWS services to excel my experiences.</p>
