<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>According to Amazon Web Services (AWS), cloud computing is on-demand delivery of IT computing resources like servers, storages, databases, networking, software, and analytics over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access the technology services, such as computing power, storage, and database, on an as-needed basis from the cloud provider like AWS.</p>

<p>AWS provides many services in cloud computing to address clients’ different matters. A solutions architect based on clients’ requirements and demands to design a flexible, reliable, scalable, and cost-effective solution that included the combination of infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, and software as a service.</p>

<p>In my Github repository, I will demonstrate some small interesting personal projects using AWS services to excel my experiences.</p>

<p>These personal projects that I have done using AWS services that are eligible to AWS Free tier. However, some of the AWS services are not entitled to the AWS Free Tier and there might be some extra costs when deploying them.
